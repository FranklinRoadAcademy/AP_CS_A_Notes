/*
    Recursion is an alternate form of looping that utilizes a method.
    This is achieved by a method calling itself until some condition has been met.

    Every recursive method has a set of properties that need to be met:
        1. The method should have a parameter or external component that is changing 
        2. A stop condition that typically looks toward the parameter or external component that is changing

    Let's look at some examples of how an Iterative implementation might look like as a Recursive one
